# OOPS! I Didn't Study — Last-minute Study Platform
This platform is designed for students who tend to leave studying to the final hour. It's intelligent, focused, and engineered to make you study smarter, not harder.

## Features
### PanicNotes
Instantly generates **structured notes**, extracts key **diagrams**, and compiles crucial **tables** from your study docs.
### Crambot
Retrieves **precise answers** only from your uploaded study material only, no hallucinations.
### Quizzard
An adaptive **quizbot** that questions you using the content of your uploaded material, so you can ace it.

## Why This Exists
Cramming studying can be very stressful. Existing tools:
- Overload you with irrelevant info
- Don’t adapt to how you learn
- Hallucinate answers

Our platform solves all that by being:
- Context-aware (only uses your material)
- Structured (turns mess into notes)
- Reliable (eliminates hallucinations)

## Tech Stack
- **LLM-powered** backend for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- File upload + context filtering for accurate responses
- Modular architecture (Crambot, Quizzard, PanicNotes)

## Future Scope
- **Multimodal Chatbot**: Text + image understanding using CLIP, BLIP
- **Smart Flashcards**: Auto-generated from content
- **Personalized Quiz Analytics**: Targeted improvement suggestions
- **Flowchart Generator**: Visualize your notes
